            Our family of companies is made up of a number of different legal
            entities and business units. In this Privacy Policy, the Controller
            or Controllers (“Controller”) of your Information means the company
            that decides the purposes for which it is processed and how it is
            processed. Which company is the Controller in relation to the
            processing of your Information will depend on which Offering you are
            using; it will often be the company responsible for providing that
            Offering, as may be set out in our terms and conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some circumstances, more than one Controller may be responsible
            for processing your Information, for example, where Information is
            shared with other companies for a purpose set out in this Privacy
            Policy. Please navigate to our Controller List for more details. If
            you still have questions about the relevant Controller, please
            contact us using one of the methods set out below.

          <p>
            Under the laws of some countries outside the European Economic Area,
            we may need your consent to our processing of your Information set
            forth in this Privacy Policy. Subject to any indications you may
            give us to the contrary, such as opting out or not opting in if
            asked, and where permitted by law, by providing Information or
            otherwise interacting with our Offerings, you consent to our use of
            Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
